.😛Hey bros, i'm from argentina, i'm too lazy to code, so i work in data analysis / data science. 
.😍My favorite code-stuff field is when it's about modding games, or when i have to work ("work", because i suck in it), in AI related fields, i'm passionate about the idea of creating tools that can make the work or life from other people easier.
